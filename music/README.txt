Place your background birthday music file here.
Suggested name: birthday.mp3

Steps:
1) Copy your MP3 into this folder and rename it to birthday.mp3 (or update wishes.html if you choose a different name).
2) Ensure the file is reasonably small (<5-8 MB) for quicker load.
3) Autoplay is requested in code, but many browsers require one user interaction before unmuted audio starts; any tap/click will unlock playback.
